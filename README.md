# My 3D Animated Portfolio

This is my personal 3D animated portfolio built with **React**, **Framer Motion**, and **Three.js**. It showcases my work, skills, and a bit of my personality through an interactive and visually appealing design.

## 🚀 Live Demo
Check out the live demo of my portfolio here: [My Portfolio](https://mominadevportfolio.netlify.app/)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React.js**: For the frontend framework
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth and intuitive animations
- **Three.js**: For creating 3D elements and effects

## 📝 Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

## 🛠 Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MominaAzam07/3d-animated-portfolio-completed.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd 3d-animated-portfolio-completed
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Project
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173/` (or a similar port).

## 📧 EmailJS Setup
To enable the contact form, you need to set up [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/):

1. Create an account on [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Create an email service and template.
3. In the root of your project, create a `.env` file and add your EmailJS credentials:
```env
VITE_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

## 📝 Usage
Once everything is set up, you can fill out the contact form, and messages will be sent directly to your configured email address via EmailJS.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more 3D elements and interactions
- Enhance performance and optimize loading times
- Include more projects and case studies
